\section{Purpose of the Software}
\label{sec:software_purpose}
The software developed in this project provides a Python library of numerical solvers for solving partial differential equations, with a focus on the Black-Scholes equation (BSE).
The current state of the software supports the implementation of finite difference methods, including the explicit and Crank-Nicolson schemes, as well as Monte Carlo simulations for option pricing.
To enhance computational efficiency, the software has been extended to leverage GPU acceleration via CUDA, optimising performance for computationally intensive tasks.

\section{Testing and Reliability} \label{sec:software_testing}
Testing is a crucial aspect of software development, ensuring that the code functionality works as intended and meets the specified requirements.
