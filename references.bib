abstract = {This title is a Pearson Global Edition. The Editorial team at Pearson has worked closely with educators around the world to include content which is especially relevant to students outside the United States. For courses in business, economics, and financial engineering and mathematics. The definitive guide to the derivatives market, updated with contemporary examples and discussions. Known as "the bible" to business and economics professionals and a consistent best-seller, Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives gives readers a modern look at the derivatives market. By incorporating the industry's hottest topics, such as the securitization and credit crisis, author John C. Hull helps bridge the gap between theory and practice. The 11th edition covers all the latest regulations and trends, including the Black-Scholes-Merton formulas, overnight indexed swaps, and the valuation of commodity derivatives.},

@book{kwok_2008_derivatives,
abstract = {Mathematical Models of Financial Derivatives is a textbook on the theory behind modeling derivatives using the financial engineering approach, focussing on the martingale pricing principles that are common to most derivative securities. A wide range of financial derivatives commonly traded in the equity and fixed income markets are analyzed, emphasizing on the aspects of pricing, hedging and their risk management. Starting from the renowned Black-Scholes-Merton formulation of option pricing model, readers are guided through the text on the new advances on the state-of-the-art derivative pricing models and interest rate models. Both analytic techniques and numerical methods for solving various types of derivative pricing models are emphasized. The second edition presents a substantial revision of the first edition. The continuous-time martingale pricing theory is motivated through analysis of the underlying financial economics principles within a discrete-time framework. A large collection of closed-form formulas of various forms of exotic equity and fixed income derivatives are documented. The most recent research results and methodologies are made accessible to readers through the extensive set of exercises at the end of each chapter. Yue-Kuen Kwok is Professor of Mathematics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. He is the author of over 80 research papers and several books, including Applied Complex Variables. He is an associate editor of Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control and Asia-Pacific Financial Markets.},
